# Venmo-Clone
The Venmo Clone project was a good practice using dictionaries in my code.  I made the funtions to only answer one question at a time.  I wanted to keep them simple for future reuse if it would be necessary.  I did have some trouble with interpolation on this project and concatenated many print statements as an alternative.
